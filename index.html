                    <h3>Our Journey Together</h3>
                    <p>Remember that first date we had at Westfield? Feels like its been forever since then huh LMAO. Looking back now, really it was one of the best days of my life. It made me realize how much I liked you and wanted to be with you and I am so so happy we went on that date.</p>
                    <p>Although, like every couple, we have had our ups and downs, we have always been there for each other no matter what, no matter how stubborn you and I are being we also stay there for each other, even if we're mad and tbh I think that's beautiful. Being able to support and encourage eachother to chase our dreams is something I cherish very much and look forward to doing to higher levels as our relationship continues. Every moment with you has been a gift, and I'm grateful for the love and happiness you bring into my life.</p>
                    <p>As we celebrate our one-year anniversary, I look forward to the many more years of love, laughter, and unforgettable moments we are going to have together. Thank you for being my beautiful, amazing, smart, strong willed and all around perfect girlfriend, my best friend, and my everything.</p>
